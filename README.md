# AWS Cloud Lab
AWS Cloud Lab is aims to facilitate educators using AWS in their teaching. Using AWS, teacher can **create the tailor made lab environment for every students in every lab exercise**, and **get rid of the physical computer limitation**. 

Mr. Cyrus Wong working group of Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) has built up the AWS Cloud Lab V1, and widely adopted in the teaching of Higher Diploma in Cloud and Data Centre Administration for 3 years. V1 is under the IP of IVE, and there are several weakness in V1 i.e. API driven, and the need of running window server. In order to share the goodness of using AWS in Lab exercise, I   rewrites the system and share to all educators who loves AWS, and hope improving their teaching with AWS.
The main focus of AWS Cloud Lab V2:

1. Integrate with existing tools - Excel for student management, and course schedule with public calendar i.e. Google Calendar.
2. Fully utilize AWS Services – allow students to rebuild the lab environments with their AWS account.
3. Automation – Educators don’t have to do anything before or after their classes.
4. Easy Deploy and Manage– Cloudformation for all deployments, and only use managed AWS Services.
5. Serverless – No server, then no server down!

AWS Cloud Lab Environments with Marking Accelerator (V1) has received 
- Gold Award - Hong Kong ICT Awards 2014: Best Student Invention (College & Undergraduates) Award by Hong Kong Government.
- APICTA 2015 - Merit Award (Tertiary Student Project)

(Marking Accelerator has moved to a new project. )
